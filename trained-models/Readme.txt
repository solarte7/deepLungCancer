Trained models on the lung cancer corpus
==================================================================================

We provide deep learning-based trained models to perform clinical NER in the lung cancer field.

1) LoadBERT.ipybn: This file contains code for loading and using the model trined with BERT.

2) LoadBiLSTM.ipybn: This file contains code for loading and using the model trined with BiLSTM.

Trained models with the lung cancer corpus can be downloaded from this link:
