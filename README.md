# Clinical NER  in the lung cancer domain
This repositoy contains a deep-learning approach to extract lung cancer concepts from clinical notes Written in Spanish.

The ropository code to perform clinical named entity recognition (CNER) using two deep learning models: BiLSTM and BERT.

In this repository you can acces the following information:

1. Python code to train deep learning models

2. Trainend models on the lung cancer corpus. These models can be downladed and used to extract named entities.

3. The lung cancer corpus  is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament. this corpus is available ``upon request''. This corpus can be accessible after an evaluation by the hospital's ethics committee.
